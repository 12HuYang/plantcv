# Welcome to the documentation for PlantCV

## Getting started

[PlantCV](http://plantcv.danforthcenter.org) is composed of modular functions in order to be applicable to a 
variety of plant types and imaging systems. In the following documentation 
we will describe use of each function and provide tutorials on how each 
function is used in the context of an overall image-processing pipeline. 
The initial release of PlantCV contains base functions that are required 
to examine images from an excitation imaging fluorometer (PSII), visible 
spectrum camera (VIS), and near-infrared camera (NIR). We are continuing 
to develop PlantCV and encourage input from the greater plant phenomics 
community. Please post questions and comments [HERE](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/issues).

**Note**: At the Danforth Center we refer to our excitation imaging 
fluorometer (PSII) camera system as 'FLU' internally. But others have 
previously published on their steady-state fluorescence imaging systems 
(a different type of fluorescence imaging system) and referred to it as 
'FLU'. We are working to make the naming changes of our functions from 
'FLU' to 'PSII' to try and prevent further confusion.

## Versions

The documentation defaults to the `latest` version of PlantCV which is the latest
commit in the `master` code branch.
Documentation for all major releases from v1.1 on are also available.

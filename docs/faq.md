- Q: Does PlantCV work with OpenCV 3.x?
    - A: Not yet, but this is a major goal for future development.
    Work towards this goal will be coordinated
    via GitHub [issue #29](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/issues/21)
    and/or [milestone #1](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/milestone/1).

- Q: How should I grow plants and acquire images for quantitative processing?
    - A: This depends on your goal,
    and is beyond the scope of the current PlantCV documentation.
    You may be be interested
    in the general advice offered by [Roeder et al. (2012)](http://doi.org/10.1242/dev.076414)

- Q: Can I use PlantCV to process photos taken with a Raspberry Pi camera?
    - A: Yes.
    Several groups are processing Pi images using PlantCV.
    You can even run PlantCV directly on a Pi,
    though this is not required.

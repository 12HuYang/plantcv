# <a id="plantcvcontributorsguide"></a>PlantCV Contributor's Guide

This document aims to give an overview of how to contribute to PlantCV. In general, contributions to PlantCV should be functions that are useful multiple users that extend either the image processing or trait analysis power of PlantCV.

Contribute in three ways:  
1.  Add new code  
2.  Maintain and improve existing code: fix bugs, improving quality or speed of functions, add more detailed documentation  
3.  Open issues and add suggestions to PlantCV [here](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/issues)

##<a id="newcode"></a> New Code to PlantCV

In General:
*  New image processing functions are highly encouraged for contribution.  
*  New trait extraction algorithms are highly encouraged for contribution.  
*  Image processing pipeline scripts that are specific for your images should **not** be added to PlantCV, unless they solve an image processing problem that you believe applies to more than one platform.

###Adding new code: Step 1.

2.  Maintain and improve existing code: fix bugs, improving quality or speed of functions, add more detailed documentation  
3.  Open issues and add suggestions to PlantCV [here](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/issues)

##<a id="newcode"></a> New Code to PlantCV

In general, new contributions to PlantCV should be functions that are useful multiple users that extend either the image processing or trait analysis power of PlantCV.  

What should/should not be added to PlantCV:
*  New image processing functions are highly encouraged for contribution.  
*  New trait extraction algorithms are highly encouraged for contribution.  
*  Image processing pipeline scripts that are specific for your images should **not** be added to PlantCV, unless they solve an image processing problem that you believe applies to more than one platform.

If you have something to add to PlantCV, please following the instructions below.

###Step 1. Open a new "New Function Proposal" forum or address an exisiting "New Function Request".

*  If you are interested in adding a completely new function to PlantCV please first add an issue to PlantCV [here](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/issues) with the label "New Function Proposal". This allow others to comment on the proposed function and lets you gauge if the function will have multiple users.
*  If someone has requested for a new function in the issues forum and you would like to address it, please post a comment on the issue to let others know that you would like to address it.

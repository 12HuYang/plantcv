##<a id="newcode"></a> New Code to PlantCV

In general, new contributions to PlantCV should benefit multiple users and extend the image processing or trait analysis power of PlantCV.  

What should/should not be added to PlantCV:
  *  New validated image processing functions are highly encouraged for contribution.  
  *  New validated trait extraction algorithms are highly encouraged for contribution.  
  *  Image processing pipeline scripts that are specific for your images should **not** be added to PlantCV, unless they solve an image processing problem that you believe applies to more than one platform/user.

Steps to adding new code are below.  

###Step 1. Open a new "New Function Proposal" forum or address an exisiting "New Function Request".

  *  If you are interested in adding a completely new function to PlantCV please first add an issue to PlantCV [here](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/issues) with the label "New Function Proposal". This allow others to comment on the proposed function and lets you gauge if the function will have multiple users.
  *  If someone has requested a new function in the issues forum and you would like to address it, please post a comment on the issue to let others know that you would like to work on it.

###Step 2. Test and document new function

  2.
  3.

###Step 3. Add function to [PlantCV-dev](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/tree/master/lib/plantcv/dev).  

  *  Add working functions to PlantCV-dev.
  *  Ensure that the new code fits with existing PlantCV functions.

###Step 4. Add documentation to
